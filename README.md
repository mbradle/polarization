# Introduction

We are developing a number [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) of possible interest for physics and astronomy.

You can run the notebooks on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) by clicking on the Open in Colab badge for each notebook.  You will need to sign in with your Google account.  Execute the whole notebook by clicking on Run all from the Runtime menu.  You can then change inputs or code in the notebook, as desired.

Alternatively, you can run on your local computer.  To do so, once you have installed [the Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), download one of the linked notebooks above (right-click or control-click).  To run the notebook from the command line, type, for example,

**jupyter notebook polarization.ipynb**

Be sure to remove any suffix that is not *.ipynb* on any notebook file you download.  For example, some browsers will by default add a *.txt* to the downloaded file so that it has suffix *.ipynb.txt*.  Remove the *.txt* before running.

If you run on your local computer, you may need to install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org).  You should be able to do that for your system through the [ffmpeg download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) site.

# Available notebooks:

* [polarization.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbradle/jupyter-notebooks/main/Notebooks/polarization.ipynb):  A Jupyter notebook to illustrate polarization in electromagnetic plane waves.  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mbradle/jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/Notebooks/polarization.ipynb)
